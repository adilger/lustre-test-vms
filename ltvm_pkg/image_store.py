"""Versioned base images, and the VM overlays that sit on them.

Each image build lands under a name of its own,
``base-<UTC stamp>-<hex>.ext4``, and ``current.ext4`` -- a symlink in
the same directory -- names the one new VMs get.  A VM's overlay is
created against the versioned file, never the pointer, so no later
build changes the bytes under an existing overlay.

``base.ext4`` is the legacy name.  Images built before this scheme sit
there as a plain file that existing overlays name as their backing
file, so nothing writes it again: it is the current image only for a
directory with no pointer, and ``ltvm clean`` removes it once no
overlay refers to it.
